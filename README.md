## About the Project

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The assignment was to recreate this [sample layout](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png), but I decided to add my own twist by theming it around One Piece.

My goal was to test my HTML and CSS fundamentals, and focus on the layout using Flexbox.

I learned a lot about structuring layouts and styling with Flexbox, and I deepened my understanding of designing web pages. Once I've learned more and gained more skills, I plan to add interactivity to this page next!
